Wall
====

Wall is an automated wall building system. I use it to wall off large areas
of the map far away from the base.

The blueprints are designed to be used together with the Foundation Rail Set
which uses 3/4 chunk aligned spacing.

The player typically builds the train stop only, everything else is built
from the materials using the robots brought in by the build train.
